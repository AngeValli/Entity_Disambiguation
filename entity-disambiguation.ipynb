    "=== Purpose ===\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to disambiguate entities in a text. For example, given a Wikipedia article:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <Paris_17>\n",
    "    Paris is a figure in the Greek mythology.\n",
    "\n",
    "the goal is to determine that <Paris_17> = <Paris_(mythology)>.\n",
    "Here, <Paris_17> is an artificial title of the Wikipedia article, and <Paris_(mythology)> is the unambiguous entity in the YAGO knowledge base.\n",
    "(https://yago-knowledge.org/graph/%22Paris%22@en?relation=all&inverse=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Provided Data ===\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide\n",
    "1) a preprocessed version of the Simple Wikipedia wikipedia-ambiguous.txt, which contains ambiguous article titles with their content, as above.\n",
    "2) a simplified version of the YAGO knowledge base.\n",
    "3) a template for your code, disambiguator.py\n",
    "4) a gold standard sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Task ===\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to complete the function disambiguate() in this file.\n",
    "It receives as input (1) the ambiguous Wikipedia title (\"Paris\" in the example), and (2) the article content.\n",
    "The method shall return the unambiguous entity from YAGO.\n",
    "In order to ensure a fair evaluation, do not use any non-standard Python libraries except NLTK.\n",
    "The lab will be graded by a variant of the F1 score that gives higher weight to precision (with beta=0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "<Babilonia_0>\n",
    "Babilonia is a 1987 Argentine drama film directed and written by Jorge Salvador based on a play by Armando Disc√©polo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "<Babilonia_0>   <Babilonia>\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Development and Testing ===\n",
    "\n",
    "In YAGO, the entities have readable ids, as in <Ashok_Kumar_(British_politician)>. This is, however, not the case in all knowledge bases. Therefore, the algorithm should not rely on the suffix \"British Politician\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce this, there are two versions of the notebook and dataset associated:\n",
    "1) Development: With readable entity ids\n",
    "The corresponding YAGO knowledge base is dev_yago.tsv, and the gold standard is dev_gold_samples.tsv\n",
    "2) Testing: Without readable entity ids\n",
    "The corresponding YAGO knowledge base is test_yago.tsv. Here, the British politician has the id <Ashok_Kumar_1081507>."
